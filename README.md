### Inspiration
The concept of "Fallen Star" emerged from the idea that in every ending there is a beginning, and in every beginning, an end. This cyclical nature of existence is mirrored in the life of stars, embodying creation and destruction in the vast dance of the cosmos.

### Creation Process
"Fallen Star" was crafted using a combination of digital painting techniques and 3D modeling, bringing to life the intricate details and dynamic compositions that define the piece. Each element was meticulously designed to contribute to the overarching theme of cosmic balance and beauty.
